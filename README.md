# Titanic_Machine_Learning_Prediction
 Using Machine learning algorithm on the  Titanic Dataset for Predicting the survival of the passenger

The most famous competition over the kaggle . In this Repository my intention is to basically explain to every beginner but how to begin with Kaggle very first time. So this repository is for those who just begin their Machine Learning Journey. In this notebook i try to take down every single topic with a very naive approach so every beginner can grasp it very easily.
